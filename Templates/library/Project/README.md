### Static and dynamic linkage

Any project that uses the the static version of the library shoud define the `LIBRARY_STATIC` macro.
To manually export the library as a shared library, the project should define the `LIBRARY_EXPORT` macro.
Using the library as a static library requires to link the external dependencies of the library (as only a dynamic library or an executable can store static dependencies).
The dependencies are listed below, the library is guaranteed to work with the specified library versions. Replacing a library with another version may or may not work.

### External dependencies

**Library** has the following external dependencies :
- Library name (Library version)

**Application** has the following external dependencies :
- Library name (Library version)
